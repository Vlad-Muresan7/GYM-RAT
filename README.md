GYM-RAT is a web application currently under development, aimed at helping users track their progress and performance during weight training sessions at the gym.

I used
*React – for building dynamic user interfaces
*Vue – for modular component integration (if both React and Vue are used, consider explaining why)
*Tailwind CSS – for fast and responsive UI design

Upcoming Features
- User profile with a login/signup
- Workout history
- Performance charts
- Mobile optimization
